I enjoy helping out Makers Grads in whatever way I can and I figured it would be useful to create and central place where I store recommendations and tips. So here it is!

At the time of writing I've been in my new job for 4 months and 3 days - enough time to feel I can start imparting some reasonable conclusions.

Things I recommend Makers Grads do after finishing the course.

PERMALINKS:  
Tips for CV.
Tips for Phone Interview.
Tips for Tech Tests.
My Alliants tech test experience.
My Sky tech test test experience.
Tips for Interview.

Questions I've Been Asked By Grads
---

_"How long did it take you to get a job?"_

Immediately after finishing Makers I was on a plane to the Middle East to do a 2 month contract in my old line of work. During that contract, I tried to get a proper TDD environment setup for Firebase (basically, trying to stub the database). I failed and gave up.

About two weeks before finishing the contract (and heading back to the UK) I applied for two jobs - one at Alliants in Southampton, through Makers, and my present job at Sky in Leeds. London?! Pah! I'll never leave Yorkshire!!

To cut a long story short, I got offered both two weeks after returning to the UK and I took the one at Sky in Leeds.

_"Did companies/interviewers ask you any hard questions?"_

Nope. Never. Not one. My only 'interviews' were: 

- Phone Interviews which were more like casual conversations about my 'backstory' and coding,
- Pairing which was literally just pairing. 

For Alliants they invited me to hang out in their office for a couple of days. There, I paired with developers who were working on real stuff. I hardly did anything, to be honest. I 'drove' a bit but it didn't really seem like they were expecting me to contribute much - I think this was because after their fairly comprehensive tech test process and possibly therefore already satisfied with my ability.

At Sky it felt more formal - they got one of their senior devs to pair with me on their standard tech test and he reported back to managers about what he made of me! But he was a very nice guy who made every effort to help me relax and _did_ **pair** with me i.e. he _helped_ me! He gave enough help so I didn't feel under too much pressure or got in a flap, and not _too_ much so he could also assess my ability. It was a comfortable and positive experience for me.
